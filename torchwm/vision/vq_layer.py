    """Re-seed codebook entries that have fallen out of use.

    Nearest-neighbour quantizers are prone to codebook collapse: a code that
    stops winning any assignment receives no further update and can never come
    back, so the effective vocabulary shrinks (visible as the perplexity metric
    dropping toward 1). The standard remedy is to periodically reset unused
    entries onto randomly drawn encoder outputs, which puts them back in a
    region of space where they can win assignments again.

    Args:
        codebook: The embedding table to modify in place.
        usage: (vocab_size,) EMA of how often each code was selected. Under an
            EMA with decay d, this converges to the code's mean assignments per
            step, so the threshold is interpretable in those units.
        z_flat: (N, C) encoder outputs from the current batch, used as the pool
            of candidate re-seed locations.
        threshold: Codes with usage below this are considered dead. Values near
            1.0 are far too aggressive for a full codebook -- with V codes and
            roughly V assignments per step the mean usage is ~1, so half the
            book would be restarted every step. See
            ``DEFAULT_DEAD_CODE_THRESHOLD``.

    Returns:
        ``(num_restarted, restarted_mask)`` -- a scalar tensor counting the codes
        that were re-seeded, and the boolean mask identifying them. Callers that
        keep their own accumulators for the codebook (the EMA quantizer's
        ``ema_embed_avg``) need the mask: they cannot recover it afterwards by
        comparing usage against the threshold, because the restart deliberately
        lifts usage above it.
