"""Tests for codebook-collapse handling in the vector quantizers.

A collapsed codebook is the quietest way for IRIS to fail: reconstruction loss
still falls (the decoder learns a constant), the world model still trains, and
only the perplexity metric reveals that the "language" the Transformer models
has a vocabulary of one.
