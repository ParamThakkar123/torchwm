    RSSM rollouts and CEM planning are sequences of very small kernels driven by

    the step collapses that overhead. It is off by default because compilation
    costs seconds to minutes on first call, recompiles whenever an input shape
    changes, and is unavailable on some builds - none of which a short run or a
    test wants to pay for.

    Falls back to the eager callable if compilation is unsupported, so callers
    never need to guard.

    module returns an ``OptimizedModule`` whose ``state_dict`` keys gain an
    ``_orig_mod.`` prefix, so checkpoints written from a compiled model will not
