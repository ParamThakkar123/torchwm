"""Perceptual loss for the IRIS discrete autoencoder.

The IRIS training objective (Micheli et al., ICLR 2023, Appendix A.1) is an
equally-weighted combination of an L1 reconstruction loss, a commitment loss and
a perceptual loss::

    L(E, D, E) = ||x - D(z)||_1
               + ||sg(E(x)) - E(z)||_2^2
               + ||sg(E(z)) - E(x)||_2^2
               + L_perceptual(x, D(z))

The perceptual term matters more here than in a typical autoencoder: the policy
is trained *entirely* on reconstructions, so anything the decoder averages away
is invisible to it. An L1-only objective happily erases a two-pixel ball in Pong
because the pixel cost of doing so is negligible.

IRIS inherits this term from VQGAN (Esser et al., 2021), which uses LPIPS
(Zhang et al., CVPR 2018): VGG16 features, unit-normalised per channel, squared
differences weighted by a set of *learned* 1x1 linear layers, averaged
spatially and summed across layers. This module reproduces that structure. The
learned linear weights are a small (~7KB) external artifact; when they are not
available the layers fall back to uniform weights, which reduces to the
"unweighted VGG feature distance" variant. That fallback is a real
approximation, not a silent equivalence -- see :class:`LPIPSPerceptualLoss`.
