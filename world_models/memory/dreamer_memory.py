class ReplayBuffer:
    """Fixed-size replay buffer for Dreamer with image observations and transitions.

    Stores (observation, action, reward, terminal) tuples in a ring buffer and
    supports sampling contiguous sequences for world-model training.

    **Key Features**

    - Ring buffer with fixed capacity (FIFO eviction when full)
    - Stores raw uint8 images to save memory
    - Samples sequences (not single transitions) for temporal modeling
    - Validates sampled sequences don't span episode boundaries

    **Memory Layout**

    - observations: (capacity, C, H, W) uint8 images
    - actions: (capacity, action_dim) float32
    - rewards: (capacity,) float32
    - terminals: (capacity,) float32 (1.0 = terminal, 0.0 = continue)

    **Sampling Process**

    1. Random start index (avoiding episode boundaries)
    2. Collect sequence of length seq_len with wraparound
    3. Validate no terminal in middle of sequence
    4. Return batch of sequences

    **Usage with Dreamer**::

        buffer = ReplayBuffer(
            size=100000,           # Max transitions to store
            obs_shape=(3, 64, 64), # RGB images
            action_size=6,         # Continuous action dim
            seq_len=50,            # Sequence length for training
            batch_size=50          # Parallel sequences per batch
        )

        # Add transitions during interaction
        buffer.add(obs, action, reward, done)

        # Sample batch for world model training
        obs_batch, action_batch, reward_batch, term_batch = buffer.sample()

    **Memory Efficiency**

    - Uses uint8 for images (1 byte per pixel vs 4 for float32)
    - Sequences share observations (overlapping windows)
    - Configurable capacity based on available system memory

    Note:
        The buffer stores observations as {"image": ...} dicts but returns
        just the image arrays for training efficiency.
