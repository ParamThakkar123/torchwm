## [1.0.0] — 2026-08-19

First stable release. The public API surface documented in
`docs/source/public_api.md` is now covered by semantic versioning: breaking
changes to it require a major version bump and a deprecation cycle.

Because 0.5.0 below was never tagged or published, upgrading from 0.4.2 — the
last release on PyPI — also brings in every 0.5.0 change.

### Known limitations
- `dreamer-v3` is a registry name for `DreamerAgent`, not a paper-complete
  DreamerV3 implementation
- Shared step-budget `train()` covers the Dreamer family; other models use
  their own trainers or `torchwm train`
- The `dmc` extra depends on `labmaze` wheels; CI does not install it on
  Python 3.13 because labmaze currently tries to compile with Bazel

### Added
- Throughput instrumentation: `torchwm.ThroughputMeter`, `torchwm.measure_steps`
  and `torchwm.tensor_nbytes` report steps/sec, ms/step and bytes shipped to the
  device per step, synchronising on CUDA so the timer measures execution rather
  than queueing
- Performance helpers: `torchwm.enable_performance_defaults` (cuDNN autotuning
  and TF32, no-ops without CUDA), `torchwm.maybe_compile` (opt-in
  `torch.compile` with an eager fallback) and `torchwm.to_channels_last`
- `GenieConfig.use_amp` / `GenieSmallConfig.use_amp` — autocast for Genie
  training, preferring bfloat16 where supported so no gradient scaler is needed
- Genie `VideoDataset` loads `.npy` / `.npz` / `.pt` clips, or video files when
  OpenCV (`torchwm[viz]`) is installed
- `DreamerConfig.perf_defaults` and `DreamerConfig.tf32`
- `RSSMPolicy(..., compile_rollout=True)` compiles the CEM candidate-rollout
  step, which runs `num_iterations * planning_horizon` tiny kernels per env step
- I-JEPA linear evaluation (`torchwm.training.eval_jepa`, exported as
  `torchwm.jepa_linear_probe` / `torchwm.load_jepa_encoder`), implementing the
  paper's Appendix A.2 protocol: frozen target-encoder, average-pooled patch
  tokens, LARS-trained linear head, and the published sweep over learning rate,
  weight decay, batch-norm head, and last-layer vs last-four-layer features
- `VisionTransformer.get_intermediate_layers()`, needed for the last-four-layer
  probe representation
- `torchwm/configs/experiments/jepa_small_gpu.yaml` — single-GPU preset
  that reduces only batch size, backbone, and epochs, leaving every method
  parameter at the paper's value
- `tests/models/test_jepa_paper_alignment.py`, pinning the I-JEPA masking,
  architecture, loss, and schedule details against the paper
- `torchwm eval --model jepa` runs the linear probe from the CLI, alongside the
  existing `--model diamond` FID/FVD/LPIPS path. The two evaluations share only
  `--checkpoint`, `--batch-size`, `--device` and `--output`; passing an option
  that belongs to the other model is an error rather than a silent no-op

### Changed
- **Breaking: one package.** The implementation moved from `world_models/` into
  `torchwm/`, and the alias layer that made `torchwm.<name>` resolve to
  `world_models.<name>` is gone. `torchwm` is now the only import path —
  `import world_models` raises `ModuleNotFoundError`. Replace
  `from world_models.x import y` with `from torchwm.x import y`; the public
  `torchwm` surface is unchanged
- **I-JEPA defaults now reproduce the paper.** The shipped configuration
  previously combined the two worst settings in the paper's own ablations:
  `enc_mask_scale` was `(0.15, 0.2)` where the context block calls for
  `(0.85, 1.0)` (Table 9), and `num_pred_masks` was `1` where the paper uses `4`
  (Table 10: 9.0 vs 54.2 low-shot top-1). View augmentations were also enabled
  by default, contradicting the paper's central claim; `use_gaussian_blur`,
  `use_horizontal_flip` and `use_color_distortion` now default to `False`.
  `min_keep` is `10`, `crop_scale` is `(0.3, 1.0)`, and the optimizer follows
  Appendix A: batch 2048, warmup 1e-4 -> 1e-3 over 15 epochs, cosine to 1e-6
- I-JEPA learning rates are quoted at the paper's batch size of 2048 and scaled
  linearly to the effective batch size; set `lr_reference_batch_size = None` to
  opt out
- I-JEPA trains with the paper's L2 loss (`loss_type="l2"`) instead of the
  reference implementation's Smooth-L1, which remains available as
  `loss_type="smooth_l1"` alongside the literal per-block sum `"l2_sum"`
- `JEPAConfig.pred_depth` defaults to `None`, which selects the paper's
  predictor depth for the configured backbone (6 for ViT-B, 12 for ViT-L/H, 16
  for ViT-G) instead of silently building a 6-layer predictor for every model
- The multi-block mask sampler draws block scale and aspect ratio from
  independent uniforms, as Sec. 3 specifies, rather than sharing one draw
- No `GradScaler` is created for bfloat16 training, which does not need loss
  scaling; `torch.autocast` replaces the deprecated `torch.cuda.amp` entry points
- Dreamer keeps replay observations in `uint8` across the host-to-device copy.
  The buffer already stores `uint8` and `preprocess_obs` already casts on the
  device, so the old `torch.tensor(obs, dtype=torch.float32)` widened the batch
  on the host and moved four times the bytes for a cast that happened anyway —
  123MB per step at stock config, now 30.7MB. Transfers use `torch.from_numpy`
  (no extra host copy) and pinned, non-blocking staging on CUDA
- The ViT/I-JEPA backbone uses `scaled_dot_product_attention` instead of an
  explicit `softmax(q @ k^T * scale) @ v`, so the (B, heads, N, N) score matrix
  is never materialised. Every other attention block in the package already did.
  A custom `qk_scale` is passed through unchanged; outputs match the explicit
  form to 1.7e-16 in float64
- Target-network EMA updates (I-JEPA, DiT) use `torch._foreach_*`: one fused
  multi-tensor op per step rather than two kernels per parameter tensor, and
  `alpha=` applies the `(1 - m)` scale inside the add instead of allocating a
  scaled copy of every source tensor. Results differ by at most one ulp, in the
  fused form's favour — it rounds once where the explicit form rounded twice
- Dataloaders pin host memory when CUDA is present and keep workers alive across
  epochs. `tinyworlds` hardcoded `pin_memory=False`, and the ImageNet loaders
  respawned every worker at each epoch boundary
- FID/LPIPS/FVD share one frozen backbone per device instead of rebuilding (and
  re-downloading) Inception or VGG for every metric instance
- The PlaNet CEM planner runs under `torch.inference_mode` rather than
  `no_grad`, and no longer clones state before broadcasting it over candidates
- The Dreamer replay buffer's sequence sampler tests the episode-boundary
  rejection arithmetically instead of materialising the index window for every
  rejected draw. The RNG is consumed identically, so a given seed still yields
  exactly the same sequences
- uv no longer resolves the whole project through a CUDA-specific PyTorch index.
  `[tool.uv]` set `https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121` as the *default*
  index with `index-strategy = "unsafe-best-match"`, which routed every package
  through it and pinned contributors to one CUDA build regardless of hardware —
  contradicting the README. Resolution now comes from PyPI; add the index for
  your platform explicitly if you need a specific wheel set

### Removed
- **Breaking:** the `torchwm.inference` operator
  package (`get_operator`, `OperatorABC`, `TensorSpec`, `DreamerOperator`,
  `JEPAOperator`, `IrisOperator`, `PlaNetOperator`). The operators only resized
  and normalized tensors, and `JEPAOperator` masked uniformly at random, which
  is not I-JEPA's masking at all. Preprocess inputs directly, or use
  `torchwm.transforms.image.make_transforms` and
  `torchwm.masks.MultiblockMaskCollator`
- **Breaking:** the unused `operator_state_dim` / `operator_action_dim` fields
  on `DiamondConfig`
- **Breaking:** the `minerl` and `minedojo` extras, and the `selenium` extra.
  Neither Minecraft extra could ever install — MineRL 1.x has no Python 3.11+
  release and MineDojo pins `gym==0.21.0`, whose sdist no longer builds — and
  between them they made `uv lock` unresolvable for the whole project.
  `torchwm.envs.minecraft_env` is unchanged; `docs/source/iris.md` documents the
  manual Python 3.10 install

### Fixed
- The multi-block mask sampler raised no error when `min_keep` exceeded the
  patches a block can hold; it now fails with an explanatory message instead of
  looping forever
- The test suite can run to completion in a single process again. Every
  `nn.Module` holds reference cycles, so a model built in a test is reclaimable
  only by CPython's cyclic collector — which triggers on allocation *counts*,
  not bytes, so a handful of very large tensors never trips it. The suite
  retained ~4.4GB (1.6GB from `tests/models/test_genie.py`, 1.4GB from
  `tests/evals/test_evals.py`) and died partway through with either
  `RuntimeError: can't start new thread` or a Windows access violation. A new
  `tests/conftest.py` collects after each test; the suite now finishes, at about
  15% more wall-clock

## [0.5.0] — 2026-07-27 (never tagged or published)

### Added
- Real PEP 561 typing stub: `torchwm/__init__.pyi` now declares every public
  export instead of falling back to `Any`, generated from the export map by
  `python -m tools.gen_type_stub` and verified in CI. `torchwm` ships a
  `py.typed` marker so the re-exports stay typed
- `torchwm play -m dreamer` — interactive REAL/DREAM playback for Dreamer
  checkpoints alongside DIAMOND (`scripts/play_dreamer.py`)
- `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` (Contributor Covenant 2.1)
- CI job running the full test suite with every optional backend installed —
  the configuration a contributor gets from `CONTRIBUTING.md`, previously
  untested
- Tests asserting every `__all__` entry resolves, that the stub matches the
  export map, and that the README algorithms table matches the model registry
- Complete `torchwm` public import surface: every implementation submodule is now
  reachable through the friendly namespace (`from torchwm.models import Dreamer`,
  `import torchwm.envs`, ...), not just top-level factory helpers
- `dmc` optional-dependency extra (`pip install torchwm[dmc]`) that installs
  `dm-control` for the default DeepMind Control backend
- Actionable error from the DMC backend that names the missing `dm_control`
  dependency and points to `torchwm[dmc]` or the gym backend

### Changed
- README "Supported Algorithms" table now lists all 13 registered models
  (previously 5), keyed by the name `create_model()` accepts
- `viz` extra installs only what it uses (opencv, umap-learn, scikit-learn,
  plotly); the unused FastAPI/uvicorn/starlette/python-multipart entries and the
  duplicated docs dependencies are gone
- CI runs the test matrix on `push` to `main` only, not on every push to a PR
  branch, which ran the whole matrix twice per commit
- Documentation, examples, and scripts now import through the `torchwm` public
  namespace
- Quick-start examples (README, docs landing page, getting-started guide) now use
  the base-installable `Pendulum-v1` gym backend so they run on
  `pip install torchwm[gym]` out of the box; DMC usage is documented separately

### Fixed
- `torchwm.DreamerRSSM` and `torchwm.MujocoEnv` raised `AttributeError` on
  access: the export map pointed `DreamerRSSM` at a module that names the class
  `RSSM`, and `MujocoEnv` had no implementation behind it (it now resolves to
  `MuJoCoImageEnv`)
- README advertised a FastAPI visualization feature that does not exist
- `create_model("dreamer", env="walker-walk")` no longer raises a bare
  `ModuleNotFoundError`; the DMC dependency is installable and the error is clear
- Broken landing-page example that called `train(env_name=..., total_steps=...)`
  (the `train` method only accepts `total_steps`)
- Env-adapter tests patched non-existent module attributes
  (`torchwm.models.dreamer.env_wrapper.*`) and the wrong Gymnasium registry
  reference, causing 10 spurious failures
- Removed stray build artifacts (`nul`, empty `testsdata/` directories) and added
  `.gitignore` guards
